    - Inefficient markets
    - Irrational behavior

2. Financial Engineering: Financial Basics

    - Financial Data
    - Returns
    - Adjusted close, stock splits and dividends
    - Volatility Clustering


3. Understanding Time Series

    - What are time series?
    - Statistics on time series

3. Exploratory Data Analysis and Static Analysis

    - QQ Plot
    - T-distribution
    - Confidence Intervals
    - Statistical Testing
    - Covariance and Correlation

4. Exponential Smoothing and ETS Methods
