### 1. Behavioral Economics: Ways people or markets misbehave

#### 1.1 Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH)
In order to get to know the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) a bit better, we will start with a bit of history. 
#### 1.1.1 History
We will start in France in the ```1860s``` where there was a French mathematician, ```Jules Regnault```, who was one of the first authors who tried to create a ```"stock exchange science"``` based on **statistical** and **probabilistic analysis**. He was the first to suggest a modern theory of stock price changes using a ```random walk``` model.

Thirty-six years later, ```Louis Bachelier``` who also happens to be a French mathematician studied the behavior of prices in the French stock and option markets. In his seminal work, which he delivered in ```1900```, he concluded that stock price changes are ```random``` and **cannot be predicted**.

Thirty years later,  ```Alfred Cowles III``` embarked on an ambitious ```5``` year project to look for evidence that the stock market is predictable. He pours over forecasts from various sources, studies a large pool of individual stock recommendations from various financial services over the course of five years. And after all that work, he can't find any evidence that the stock market is predictable. 

In the 1950s, ```Maurice Kendall``` studied different British equity and commodity prices, and again, searches for clues and prices to predict future economic cycles.
But he only finds more evidence that prices move ```randomly```. At about the same time, stock market movements was identified as following a ```Brownian motion``` which is described as the random movement of particles in nature, as first identified by the biologist ```Robert Brown``` in the ```1800s```.

Finally, in ```1970``` the great ```Eugene Fama``` developed the **Efficient Market Hypothesis** which in simple words states that it is impossible to "beat the market" consistently.

#### 1.1.2 Intuition
Throughout history, we have seen a great deal of "pessimism" but let's suppose for a second we could really develop a model which could detect the market price.
